                Hey! My name is James. I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and have always had a strong love for the beauty of this state.
                I graduated from White House High School in 2014 and spent many years living my lifelong dream of being a musician, playing shows in Nashville and the surrounding areas.
                When the pandemic began, I decided to broaden my skillsets and took the plunge into learning web development. I am a certified full-stack web developer with experience
                in many front-end and back-end technologies.

                I have always had a passion for technology and have enjoyed development immensely.
